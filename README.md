# Energy Custom Graph
This is a lightweight graph card that supports the Home Assistant energy date picker for time range selection. It reuses the built-in ECharts instance shipped with Home Assistant, so you get native styling with minimal overhead.

Unlike the default energy cards like `energy-usage-graph`, this card is not limited to the energy dashboard entities. Any long-term statistic available in the recorder database can be used. You can choose the statistic type (`change`, `sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `state`) for each series displayed.
I know the `Statistics graph card` nowadays also support the energy date picker, but it didn't provide all the features I needed.

## Key Features

- This card has an full-featured graphical editor, so almost all settings can be done through the UI.
- Displayed timespan sync with the energy date picker (`energy-date-selection`).
- Supports any entity that exposes long-term statistics.
- Quick access to colors from the HA energy color palette and native styles so mixed dashboards look consistent.
- Uses Home Assistant's bundled ECharts runtime – no extra framework needs to be loaded.
- Per-series control over aggregation type, chart type (bar or line), stacking, color, unit, scaling and offsets.
- Optional fill-between-rendering for line series to fill the space e.g. between min / max line-charts
- Optional manual timespan selection (fixed ranges or relative day/week/month/year offsets) when you don't want to use the energy date picker.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, open *HACS > Frontend* and click the three-dot menu in the top right.
2. Choose *Custom repositories*, add `https://github.com/Thyraz/energy-custom-graph`, and leave the category set to *Lovelace*.
3. Search for "Energy Custom Graph" in HACS, install the latest release.
4. Reload the browser and clear the Browser cache if the card won't show up immediately.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest `energycustomgraph.js` from the repository release or the `dist/` folder.
2. Copy it into your Home Assistant config directory, e.g. `config/www/community/energy-custom-graph/energycustomgraph.js`.
3. Add the resource to Lovelace (Settings → Dashboards → Resources → **+ ADD RESOURCE**):
   - URL: `/local/community/energy-custom-graph/energycustomgraph.js`
   - Resource type: `JavaScript Module`
4. Clear your browser cache and Reload the page.

## Usage

Add the card to a dashboard using the graphical card editor or via YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:energy-custom-graph-card
title: Custom energy overview
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_grid_import
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_grid_export
    stat_type: change
    chart_type: line
    fill: true
```

The card supports the energy date pickerfor timespan selection. Place an `energy-date-selection` control on the same dashboard and set `timespan.mode: "energy"` (which is the default). For other timespan modes, see the `timespan` configuration below.

## Configuration

By default the card mirrors the core energy cards and automatically selects the recorder statistics period (5-minute, hourly, daily, or monthly) based on the chosen timespan. You can override this behaviour via the `aggregation` options described below.

### Generic card options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `type` | string | – | Must be `custom:energy-custom-graph-card`. |
| `title` | string | – | Optional card header. |
| `chart_height` | string | – | CSS height (e.g. `300px`). |
| `timespan` | object | `{mode: "energy"}` | Controls the time range displayed (see below). |
| `collection_key` | string | – | Custom key when multiple energy date pickers are present (only for `timespan.mode: "energy"`). <br>[More Info](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/energy/#using-multiple-collections) |
| `hide_legend` | boolean | `false` | Hide the legend entirely. |
| `legend_sort` | `"asc"`, `"desc"`, `"none"` | `"none"` | Sort order for the legend entries. |
| `expand_legend` | boolean | `false` | Expand the legend by default. |
| `tooltip_precision` | number | – | Override numeric precision in the tooltip. |
| `show_unit` | boolean | `true` | Show corresponding units from the recorder database when available in tooltips and axes. |
| `y_axes` | list | – | Y axis configuration for both left and right axes (see below). |
| `aggregation` | object | auto | Control recorder aggregation intervals. See below. |
| `series` | list | – | One or more series definitions (see below). |

### Timespan options

The `timespan` configuration controls the time range displayed by the card. Currently three modes are supported::

**Mode: `energy` (default)**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: energy
```
Use a energy date picker on the same dashboard. The card automatically follows the selected range.

**Mode: `relative`**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: relative
  period: day        # hour, day, week, month, year, last_7_days, last_30_days, or last_12_months
  offset: -1         # Optional offset (e.g., -1 for yesterday/previous period)
```
Displays a relative time period. The card supports two types, inspired by the options in the energy date picker:

***Calendar-based periods*** (`hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`):
- "day" would mean today from 00:00 to 23:59 as base date
- `offset` shifts by complete periods (e.g., `-1` for yesterday, `-7` for same day last week)

***Rolling window periods*** (`last_7_days`, `last_30_days`, `last_12_months`):
- End date is "now"
- `last_7_days`: Previous 7 days
- `last_30_days`: Previous 30 days
- `last_12_months`: Previous 12 months
- `offset` shifts the entire window (days or months based on period used.)

**Mode: `fixed`**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: fixed
  start: "2024-01-01T00:00:00"   # Optional, defaults to start of today
  end: "2024-01-31T23:59:59"     # Optional, defaults to end of start day
```
Display a fixed time range. Dates use ISO 8601 format. If omitted, `start` defaults to the beginning of today and `end` defaults to the end of the start day.

### `series` options - Configure the entities to use

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `name` | string | entity name | Display name shown in tooltip and legend. |
| `statistic_id` | string | – | Entity with long term statistics (e.g. `sensor.entity_id`). Required unless series uses a `calculation` instead. |
| `stat_type` | `"change"`, `"sum"`, `"mean"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"state"` | `"change"` | Statistic type to display for this entity. Not used when `calculation` is provided, as each subseries has it's own setting there. |
| `calculation` | object | – | Build a computed series from multiple statistics / terms (see below). |
| `chart_type` | `"bar"`, `"line"` | `"bar"` | Chart type. |
| `stack` | string | – | Stack key for combining series. Series with identical keys will get stacked on top of each other. |
| `y_axis` | `"left"`, `"right"` | `"left"` | Axis assignment. |
| `show_in_legend` | boolean | `true` | Whether to display this series in the legend. If `false`, the series remains visible in the chart but has no legend entry. |
| `hidden_by_default` | boolean | `false` | Whether the series is initially hidden when the chart loads. The series can still be toggled via the legend. |
| `color` | string | next in palette | Specific color (supports `#rrggbb`, `rgb()` or CSS variables). |
| `line_opacity` | number | style default | Override stroke opacity (0–1). Defaults to 0.85 for line charts and 1.0 for bar outlines. |
| `line_width` | number | `2` | Line thickness in pixels (line charts only). |
| `line_style` | `"solid"`, `"dashed"`, `"dotted"` | `"solid"` | Line pattern style (line charts only). |
| `fill` | boolean | `false` | Fill the area underneath the line. |
| `fill_opacity` | number | style default | Override fill opacity (0–1). Defaults to 0.15 for line charts and 0.5 for bars. |
| `fill_to_series` | string | – | For line charts only: name of another line series to fill towards. Both series must not be stacked. |
| `smooth` | boolean or number | `true` | Line smoothing. Use `false` to disable and true for the default HA behavior. Or provide a value between 0 and 1 for finer control. |
| `multiply` | number | `1` | Apply a multiplier to each series value. |
| `add` | number | `0` | Apply an additive offset after multiplication. |
| `clip_min` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are smaller. |
| `clip_max` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are larger. |

#### Calculated series

Configure `calculation` instead of `statistic_id` to compute a series from multiple entity statistics. Terms are processed sequentially, starting with the `initial_value` (default `0`).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `terms` | list | – | Ordered list of calculation steps. |
| `initial_value` | number | `0` | Start value before the first term. |
| `unit` | string | inferred | Unit for the resulting series (inferring looks for the first statistic used). |

Each term accepts the following options:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `operation` | `"add"`, `"subtract"`, `"multiply"`, `"divide"` | `"add"` | Operation applied in this step of the calculation. |
| `constant` | number | – | Constant number to use in this term. Use alternatively to providing a `statistic_id`. All keys below in this section are ignored in this case. |
| `statistic_id` | string | – | Entity with long term statistics (e.g. `sensor.entity_id`). Do not use in combination with setting `constant` in the same term. |
| `stat_type` | `"change"`, `"sum"`, `"mean"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"state"` | inherit | Statistic type to display for this entity. |
| `multiply` | number | `1` | Apply a multiplier to each series value. |
| `add` | number | `0` | Apply an additive offset after multiplication. |
| `clip_min` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are smaller. |
| `clip_max` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are larger. |

#### Fill between line series

Set `fill_to_series` on a line series to fill the area between this and the targeted line. The value must match the `name` of the target series. Requirements:

- Both series must be rendered as lines (no bars) and must not use stacking.
- The referenced `name` has to be unique within the configuration.
- When the upper series drops below the lower one, the card sets the fill to zero and logs a warning.
- The fill_opacity used is the one configured on the upper series' `fill_opacity` (or the default if unspecified).

### `y_axes` options

Configure both left and right Y axes individually. The right axis appears automatically when a series uses `y_axis: right` or when an explicit `right` axis configuration exists.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `id` | `"left"`, `"right"` | – | Axis selector to override (`left` is primary). |
| `min` | number | auto | Minimum axis value. **Note:** Ignored when `center_zero` is active. |
| `max` | number | auto | Maximum axis value. When `center_zero` is active, this value is used for both positive and negative bounds (e.g., `max: 10` creates range -10 to +10). |
| `fit_y_data` | boolean | `false` | Force this axis to fit its data range tightly. |
| `center_zero` | boolean | `false` | Center the axis around zero by making min/max symmetric (e.g., -10 to +10). Useful for visualizing positive and negative values with zero aligned. If `max` is set, uses ±max; otherwise calculates from data. |
| `logarithmic_scale` | boolean | `false` | Apply logarithmic scaling to this axis. |
| `unit` | string | metadata | Override unit label for this axis. |

### Aggregation options

Possibility to override the aggregation interval. By default, the card mirrors HA’s energy cards (hours for daily, days for weekly/monthly, months for yearly ranges).

```yaml
aggregation:
  manual: hour          # Used when the card is not linked to the energy date picker
  fallback: day         # Used if the preferred aggregation returns no data
  energy_picker:
    day: 5minute
    week: hour
    month: day
    year: month
```

- `manual` applies when the timespan mode is `relative` or `fixed` (energy date picker not used).
- `energy_picker` sets the aggregation used when the energy date picker selects `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, or `year` ranges. Any range not listed keeps the default value.
- `fallback` Optional. Is used if the preferred interval returns no data.
- Valid intervals: `"5minute"`, `"hour"`, `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`.

Tip: use fine intervals only for short ranges to avoid excessive resource usage and loading times.

hide_legend: true
series:
  - name: Solar self consumed
    chart_type: bar
    color: "--energy-solar-color"
    stack: energy
    clip_min: 0   # self-consumption should never get negative. Clip in case the value should be zero and gets a little bit negative due to rounding errors
    calculation:  # self-consumption is: total pv production - export to grid - battery charge
      unit: kWh
      terms:
        - statistic_id: sensor.total_solar_production
          operation: add
        - statistic_id: sensor.total_grid_export
          operation: subtract

    stack: energy
  - statistic_id: sensor.total_battery_charge
    name: Battery charge
    chart_type: bar
    multiply: -1
    color: "--energy-battery-in-color"
    stack: energy
```

## Tips

- Ensure recorder and long-term statistics are enabled for every entity you plan to use.
- Use the relative period mode with positive or negative offsets to jump by whole days, weeks, months, or years.
- When using `fill_to_series`, keep `name` values unique and avoid stacking for the involved series.
- When using multiple energy date pickers on a single dashboard, provide the appropriate `collection_key` so the card links to the correct selection.
- Combine `multiply` and `add` to convert units (e.g. Wh to kWh) without the need for extra template sensors.
